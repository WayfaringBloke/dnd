	3. **Bear!:** HP: 20 Armour: - Morale: 6 Weapon: Claws d4 / Jaws d6

	1. Head back through forest with drunk Englishman
	2. Players are advised to either wait out the tank or approach it on foot
	4. Return to checkpoint (if he is hiding DR16 Presence to pass, else combat)
	5. Wait out: Have to put up with rambling Englishman, stop him from drinking 0K
	6. Attack: On foot so truck doesn't get fucked, sneak up and pour 0K over it, gunner passes out, tank becomes brittle.
6. Debrief
	1. Englishman has been bitching about revolutionaries on and off, turns out Ronald is actually part of an underground movement that Englishman is the weapons tech for.
