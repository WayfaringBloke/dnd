# Whiskey
1. 2nd Cowboy Job:
2. Drive there
3. Approach House
	1. Among snow and thick pine tress road turns to path turns to nothing
	2. Second Checkpoint, one friendly guy there who chats at you for ages, stalling.
	3. **Bear!:** HP: 20 Armour: - Morale: 6 Weapon: Claws d4 / Jaws d6
	4. Steep (but not v. high) cliff ahead of you, have to leave truck behind (if the truck is taken the sniper shoots out its tires)
	5. Rocky winding path up to house, sniper on roof. House is squat log cabin.
	6. **Sniper:** HP: 15 Armour: - Morale: - Weapon: d8  (but worse outside player range, arbitrary small hits)
		(Is actually Salas Sawyer, best not to kill him)
4. At house
	1. Salas Sawyer inside, charismatic posh English too drunk on mountain whiskey to leave
	2. Hard to convince to leave, wants to bring a barrel back with him
	3. Also a variety of luxury beverages:
		1. Barrelled Wine: Toughness DR14, Pass: +1 Presence (day), Fail: Pretentious Tasting notes
		2. 0K coolant x 3: Steel bottle, when poured will freeze something very much
		3. Luxury Whiskey: 600 c
		4. A lot of mediocre whiskey
5. Return
	1. Head back through forest with drunk Englishman
	2. Players are advised to either wait out the tank or approach it on foot
	4. Return to checkpoint (if he is hiding DR16 Presence to pass, else combat)
	5. Wait out: Have to put up with rambling Englishman, stop him from drinking 0K
	6. Attack: On foot so truck doesn't get fucked, sneak up and pour 0K over it, gunner passes out, tank becomes brittle.
6. Debrief
	1. Englishman has been bitching about revolutionaries on and off, turns out Ronald is actually part of an underground movement that Englishman is the weapons tech for.
	2. Ronald admits his marxism, hook for next mission protecting a BlueCollar picket line
	3. Pays you handsomely and will buy the Luxury Whiskey, totalling another 1.2k c
	4. Also throws in the truck
