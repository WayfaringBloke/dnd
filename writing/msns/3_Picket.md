# Picket
1. Multi-storey graveyard
	1. Called there in very early hours of morning, urgent high paying job
	2. Meet Frankie in the back of a mechanic's van
	3. His regular security team fell through, needed someone on very short notice
	4. You come highly recommended from Ronald
	5. Need to defend a picket line of workers against scabs
	6. Gives you blue overalls to fit in with the crowd
2. The Build-up
	1. Driven in the back of an uncomfy van for an hour
	2. Boiling hot whiskey + coffee severed from a barrel marked biohazard. DR 14 Toughness, +1 Worker Solidarity, d2 damage
	3. Talk to workers about their struggles, try to pretend to be workers yourself 
	4. Sawyer sets up on nearby rooftop with sniper
3. Scabs
	1. A bunch of guys pull up in green overalls
	2. They try to cross the picket, blue collars block them
	3. Players should control the situation - if not they murder the green overalls
	4. If they murder the green overalls then heavily cybered green overalls
	5. Combat! 
4. The assault seems never-ending but an Osha warrior saves you
5. Dead man's switch suicide bomber
