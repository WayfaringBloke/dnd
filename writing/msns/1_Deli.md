## Dining Area
- A narrow corridor leads up to a cramped dining area, with a bar & stools facing the wall.
- There's a large soda vending machine and a deli counter with a posh brit stood behind it.
- The resturaunt serves primarily deli food, but also hash browns and a smattering of british dishes (toad in the hole, full breakfast, bangers & mash, fish & chips). 
- In the drinks cabinet there's literally only two things: cans of OrangeLime, a popular soda, and Cold Leprechaun's Brew, a 50/50 mix of whiskey and strong black coffee. Fucking exclusivity deals.
- **SECURITY:** Gun that fires through wall in narrow corridor

## Pantry
- Heavy bags of flour, cornstarch, and various ingredients.
- A jarring amount of pickles. It smells entirely too much of pickles.
- Just ouside it in the coridoor is the opaque red stone in a display case (with alarmed sticker)

## Closet
- A mix of kitchen wear. 
- A few clean suits. 
- An SMG (d4a). 

## Kitchen
- All stainless steel. 
- Pots dangle from the ceiling above the central table
- In one corner there is 2 giant piles of potatoes, one peeled the other unpeeled
- Along the far wall a deep fat fryer quietly fizzling
- Strong smell of fish & raw beef (blood)
- Two cooks in there, one throws knives at you the other has a d4a pistol in his waistband

## Freezer
- Secured by a thick steel door
- Insulation blocks out noise from the outside
- Has 3 gangsters in there trying to get gems out of the bellies of pigs, cows, and fish.
- Blood spilled everywhere
- All 3 are wearing the white clean suits, bloodied. 
- Carrying a large machete/axe (d8) and pistols (d6)
- Shelves full of almost everything you saw on the menu, nothing is fresh prepared here.
- Central table holds a chopping board and a little tupperware where the bloody gems have been collected.
