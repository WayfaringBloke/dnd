## Dining Area
- A narrow corridor leads up to a cramped dining area, with a bar & stools facing the wall.
- There's a large soda vending machine and a deli counter with a posh brit stood behind it.
- The resturaunt serves primarily deli food, but also hash browns and a smattering of british dishes (toad in the hole, full breakfast, bangers & mash, fish & chips). 
- In the drinks cabinet there's literally only two things: cans of OrangeLime, a popular soda, and Cold Leprechaun's Brew, a 50/50 mix of whiskey and strong black coffee.

## Pantry
- Heavy bags of flour, cornstarch, and various ingredients.
- A jarring amount of pickles.

## Closet
- A mix of kitchen wear. 
- A few clean suits. 
- An SMG (d4a). 

## Kitchen
All stainless steel. Pots dangle from the ceiling above the central table
