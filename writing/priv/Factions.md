# Factions

## Gangs
### West Side
A gang of Germans, their focus on efficiency slows down their operations. They typically shoot rifles/pistols and other precision weaponry, prefering long range encounters. They dispose of bodies methodically by dissolving them in acid attained from the industrial district.  

### East Side
A gang of gung-ho Russians, their slapdash & brutal approach leaves some loose ends. They focus on volume of fire using no stock AKs with a wide variety of modifications from high RoF low caliber to auto shotguns.
