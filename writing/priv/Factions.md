# Factions

## Gangs
### West Side
Unruly Germans, their focus on efficiency slows down their operations. They typically shoot rifles/pistols and other precision weaponry, prefering long range encounters. They dispose of bodies methodically by dissolving them in acid attained from the industrial district.  

### East Side
Gung-ho Russians, their slapdash & brutal approach leaves some loose ends. They focus on volume of fire using no stock AKs with a wide variety of modifications from high RoF low caliber to auto shotguns. They dispose of bodies by cutting off their arms and legs and burying those and leaving the rest of the body in the streets.

### OGs
Disciplined Texans, they focus on respect and loyalty
