# Factions

## Gangs
### West Side
Unruly Germans, their focus on efficiency slows down their operations. They typically shoot rifles/pistols and other precision weaponry, prefering long range encounters. They dispose of bodies methodically by dissolving them in acid attained from the industrial district.  

### East Side
Gung-ho Russians, their slapdash & brutal approach leaves some loose ends. They focus on volume of fire using no stock AKs with a wide variety of modifications from high RoF low caliber to auto shotguns. They dispose of bodies by cutting off their arms and legs and burying those and leaving the rest of the body in the streets.

Their blacksites primarily hold people from the industrial district as they

### OGs
Disciplined Texans, they focus on respect and loyalty over money and power, which does not get them much money or power. Training like a military they shoot primarily revolvers and shotguns, incredibly good shots. They dispose of bodies by givng them a proper burial out on a farm (but store them in welded shut metal coffins in the meantime).

Their blacksites hold primarily Central people as their honour makes them less likely to take bribes and they despise the central people for ruining the old town.

They run the cities biggest Casino.
