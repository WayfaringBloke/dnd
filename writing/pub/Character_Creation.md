**IMPORTANT:** Toughness impacts HP so dumping it will make your character extremely fragile.

If you configure [this site](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html) with the custom rules below (only 3 on the left have changed), you can ignore one stat (leave it at 8) to work out what possible combinations of modifiers. It's just for illustration purposes though and the table above is final.

## Roll vs Choose
Choose anything on your character page (or any time your character page directly references another part of the book), Otherwise roll. So the hacker picks both their apps, the gang goon picks 1-6 weapons. The only exception is armor which you still do roll.

## HP
 $HP = ceil($ toughness stat $\div 2)  +$ class dice roll
(Note: you do *actually* roll your class bonus HP)
