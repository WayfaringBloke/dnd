**IMPORTANT:** Toughness impacts HP so dumping it will make your character extremely fragile.

If you configure [this site](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html) with the custom rules below (only 3 on the left have changed), you can ignore one stat (leave it at 8) to work out what possible combinations of modifiers. It's just for illustration purposes though and the table above is final.

## Roll vs Choose
Choose anything on your character page (or any time your character page directly references another part of the book), Otherwise roll. So the hacker picks both their apps, the gang goon picks 1-6 weapons. The only exception is armor which you still do roll.

## HP
 $HP = ceil($ toughness stat $\div 2)  +$ class dice roll
(Note: you do *actually* roll your class bonus HP)

## Alternate Backgrounds
Since we're in a different city to Cy, here's a few general suggestions for backgrounds for classes (though any other ideas are welcome, this list is hardly exhaustive).
 
### Shunned Nano-Mancer
You got infected when:
-  Overdosing on Fin you had visions of an alternate Finspace, erroded by nature; long past the corporate status-quo. 
- Growing up in (blank) extremely close to the exclusion zone.
- You were kidnapped and subjected horrible experiments.
- Travelling across the salt flats, searching for something you lost.

### Burned Hacker
You have seen enough information to convince you that:
- Everyone in Cloud City is dead, and has been for half a decade.
- Royal West covered up a massacre of protestors in 0045.
- There's gold bullions buried all over the salt flats.
- Douglas Sallow is still alive and held captive by Reeves.
- Ingraham Reeves is gay.

 


### Discharged Corp Killer (Ex-Military)
The worst war crime you saw was:
- The execution of PoWs

- Use of chemical weapons
- contracted to demolish a skyscraper, death count 2'400. 
- dirty bomb 

### Orphaned Gear Head (Lone-Wolf)
You trusted them (parents, friends, etc.), and then they:
- Disappeared in the slums
- Died in a car crash
- Joined a gang

### Rengade Cyber Slasher
You swore an oath to:
- Osha
- Yourself
- Exclusion Zone
- Nature
- Temperance

### Forsaken Gang-Goon
Your loyalty is because:
- Hostage
- Ideological (Protest) (Anti-Cybernetic?)
- Infatuated with a higher up
- Family
