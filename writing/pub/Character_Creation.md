**IMPORTANT:** Toughness impacts HP so dumping it will make your character extremely fragile.

If you configure [this site](https://chicken-dinner.com/5e/5e-point-buy.html) with the custom rules below (only 3 on the left have changed), you can ignore one stat (leave it at 8) to work out what possible combinations of modifiers. It's just for illustration purposes though and the table above is final.

## Roll vs Choose
Choose anything on your character page (or any time your character page directly references another part of the book), Otherwise roll. So the hacker picks both their apps, the gang goon picks 1-6 weapons. The only exception is armor which you still do roll.

## HP
 $HP = ceil($ toughness stat $\div 2)  +$ class dice roll
(Note: you do *actually* roll your class bonus HP)

## Alternate Backgrounds
Since we're in a different city to Cy, here's a few general suggestions for backgrounds for classes (though any other ideas are welcome, this list is hardly exhaustive).
 
### Shunned Nano-Mancer
You got infected when:
-  After overdosing on Fin you had visions of an alternate Finspace, erroded by nature; long past the corporate status-quo. 
- Living in the shadow of the exclusion zone isnt prodocutive to the development of any swallodian citizen.  (childhood near over 3.6 rontgen)
- You were kidnapped and subjected horrible experiments.

### Burned Hacker
You have seen enough information to convince you that:
- Everyone in Cloud City is dead, and has been for half a decade.
- Royal West covered up a massacre of mass protests in Xim in 045.
- Douglas Sallow wrote maunscripts at the end of his life that are tyrades against his govt, and the 1st one is still out there somewhere.
- Ingraham Reeves is gay.


### Discharged Corp Killer (Ex-Military)
The worst war crime you saw was:
- execution of PoWs
- use of chemical weapons
- contracted to demolish a skyscraper, death count 2'400. 
- dirty bomb 

### Orphaned Gear Head (Lone-Wolf)
You trusted them, and then they:
- Disappeared in the slums
- Were proclaimed dead
- 

### Rengade Cyber Slasher
- (Ex) devotee of the cult of Osha, acting like samurai but for enforcing health and safety regulations

### Forsaken Gang-Goon
Gang options:
- "Union" Fixer
- Slum
