### What year is it?
I am not going to define this, don't ask. It's a boring & pointless restriction on creativity.

### Nation: Sallowdia
Years are numbered since Sallowdia's founding, starting at year 0001
**Founder:** Douglas Sallow
**Dictator:** Ingraham Reeves

### History
- <001 - An "unsettled" territory for being resoruceless and quite near the exclusion zone
- 0001 - Douglas Sallow's company discovered massive Cobalt deposits in the mountains to the north.
- 0019 - Douglas Sallow lead a failed land-grab on [Country to North].
This weakness led to years of religious urnrest with the people in the mountains rebelling. Eventually Sallow defeated this problem by genocide.
- 0042 - Sallow dies, Royal West Shipping Co. takes over
- 0046 - Restrictions placed on who could live where, Sallowers vs Natives
- 0080 - Royal West Backs out as the Cobalt mines are running dry and political tension is rising. Ingraham rises to power as man willing to defend Sallow's legacy when even Royal West won't.
- 0091 - It has become clear to almost everyone that the cobalt mines have run out.

### Farmland
Mostly making cash crops for Royal West under new contracting agreement. Farmers are poorer than dirt, cannot afford the food they grow
### Mountains
Occupied by Xin faction, highly militarised. Traditionalists focused on liberty, but in a still quite repressive way, think the Khibutz which are "anarchist" but people are judged for reading different papers. 

Contains cobalt mines which the Xin run security for.

They wear all white: fur coat, cargo pants, balaclava, believe in mountain marxism (utterly insane).

Controlled by the Xin (pronounced ks-in), they wear all white: fur coat, cargo pants, balaclava.
Highly territorial Maoists. Run everything very inefficiently. Backyard Iron Foundries. Armed with weapons with loads of wood trims, AK like things, SVDs like things, Blowback pistols with wooden grips.

### Exclusion Zone
All knowledge of the exclusion zone is destroyed immediately with extreme prejudice. Only thing known is that the closer you get to the border the more radioactive things get. 

A corporate military with no clear markings now maintains a border around it. 

## City: Xim
Unmaintained for approaching a decade the weight of the past has crushed our city's future. The sky is the color of a Television turned to a dead channel. The cloud engulfing the city is about 8 years old.

### Slums
Built of sheet metal, temporary antigravity generators, and broken dreams. Overflowing with gang violence and drug abuse.

### Industrial District
Where all Sallowdia's production is concentrated (to make it easier to control). Due to zoning laws and planning nightmares it is a gigantic looming tower of factories built on factories. Strong "union" control, cult of Osha enforces safety guidelines like samurai.

### Old Town
From before the Cobalt deposits were discovered, the old town still shows a simpler time of wooden houses painted in bright colors. Once a rather

### HyperMall
Once an audiovisual cacophony of consumption, a decade of neglect has left this paradise of popular luxury decrepit and empty. Its surronded by an increasingly desperate series of supports trying to prevent it from falling over.

### Cloud City
Tethered to the HyperMall the cloud city once flew miles above cloud level to allow its residents to experience a beautiful clear sky (and get skin cancer). Due to poor maintenance and fuel costs it now runs only a few hundred meters above the HyperMall. Its residents are extremely insular so nobody knows what it looks like up there.

### FinSpace
A global hallicination, where all finance is conducted. Entered by taking the halucinogenic upper "Fin", its an endless series of skyscrapers connected by metro tunnels. Since FinSpace is a collective hallucination there is no way to conventionally hack into it and imaginary security measures are often the most powerful. Fin will put you into FinSpace for approximately 5 + d12 days, which the user sees ticking down on a clock on their wrist the entire time.
