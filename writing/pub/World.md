### What year is it?
I am not going to define this, don't ask. It's a boring & pointless restriction on creativity.

### Nation: Sallowdia
Years are numbered since Sallowdia's founding, starting at year 0001
**Founder:** Douglas Sallow
**Dictator:** Ingraham Reeves

### History
- <001 - An "unsettled" territory for being resoruceless and quite near the exclusion zone so the only people who live there were either very attached or had nowhere else to go (probably both)
- 0001 - Douglas Sallow's company discovered massive Cobalt deposits in the mountains to the north.
- 0019 - Douglas Sallow lead a failed land-grab on [Country to North].
This weakness led to years of religious urnrest with the people in the mountains rebelling. Eventually Sallow defeated this problem by genocide.
- 0042 - Sallow dies, Royal West Shipping Co. takes over
- 0080 - Royal West Backs out as the Cobalt mines are running dry and political tension is rising. Ingraham rises to power as man willing to defend Sallow's legacy when even Royal West won't.
- 0091 - It has become clear to almost everyone that the cobalt mines have run out.

### Farmland
Mostly making cash crops for Royal West under new contracting agreement. Farmers are poorer than dirt, cannot afford the food they grow.

Contains the city of (blank) which is literally like 80% an airport. Extremely secure many executives actually live in the airport.

### Mountains
Makes for a beautiful view from the city, 
Occupied by Tuy faction, highly militarised. Traditionalists focused on liberty. Contains cobalt mines which the Tuy run security for.

### Exclusion Zone
All knowledge of the exclusion zone is destroyed immediately with extreme prejudice. Only thing known is that the closer you get to the border the more radioactive things get. 

A corporate military with no clear markings now maintains a border around it.

### Salt Flats
Extremely flat, rather salty.

## City: Xim
Unmaintained for approaching a decade the weight of the past has crushed our city's future. The sky is the color of a Television turned to a dead channel.

Since the police haven't been paid for almost half a decade, corporations & gangs have largely taken over their roles. The only police that are still paid are

### Slums
Built of sheet metal, temporary antigravity generators, and broken dreams. Overflowing with gang violence and drug abuse.

Features 3 major gangs:
- West Side - Germans - Meticulous, Dilligent
- East Side - Russians - Brutal, Efficient
- OGs - Texans - Honourable, Resourceful

### Industrial District
Where all Sallowdia's production is concentrated (to make it easier to control). Due to zoning laws and planning nightmares it is a gigantic looming tower of factories built on factories. Strong "union" control, cult of Osha enforces safety guidelines like samurai. The "unions" function more like agencies, paying workers per action in the factory. 

### Old Town
From before the Cobalt deposits were discovered, the old town still shows a simpler time of wooden houses painted in bright colors. Once a rather nice middle class town, the departure of Royal West also caused a mass exodus of the middle classes, who no longer felt safe. A mistake at a few real estate focused investment firms led to them buying up all these houses as the middle class fled, and due to complex accounting selling would realise their losses from this destroying the reputations of their firms. These investors employ varying levels of security on their buildings but have very little investment in preventing crime from happening outside their land.  Features a hospital, doomed commerical buildings, estate agent buildings.

### HyperMall
Once an audiovisual cacophony of consumption, a decade of neglect has left this paradise of popular luxury derelict. Its surronded by an increasingly desperate series of supports trying to prevent it from falling over.

### Central
The shrivelled heart of Xim, where beuracrats and businessmen manage the nation's decline. Bland offices tower over stout apartment blocks, ad screens are so common the street lights never need to be turned on.

. Features the parliment building, CID (Central Information Department) building, many Fin dens, 

### Cloud City
Tethered to the HyperMall the cloud city once flew miles above cloud level to allow its residents to experience a beautiful clear sky (and get skin cancer). Due to poor maintenance and fuel costs it now runs only a few hundred meters above the HyperMall. Its residents are extremely insular so nobody knows what it looks like up there.

### FinSpace
A global hallicination, where all finance is conducted. Entered by taking the halucinogenic upper "Fin", its an endless series of skyscrapers connected by metro tunnels. Since FinSpace is a collective hallucination there is no way to conventionally hack into it and imaginary security measures are often the most powerful. Fin will put you into FinSpace for approximately 5 + d12 days, which the user sees ticking down on a clock on their wrist the entire time.
