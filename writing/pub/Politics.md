## Issues
- **The Cyber Gap**
	Sallow's govt resisted the proliferation of cybernetics, heavily regulating their use, which was relaxed by Royal West and completely forgotten by Reeves. So much of the population is far less enhanced than more modernised nations. There is now a heavy pressure to get enhanced to work better, longer and, harder. 
-  **The Cobalt Yeild**
	Cobalt has been sub-opt



## What kind of Sallow reader are you
- [ ] Shameless oppurtunist 
- [ ] Joker who's never read Sallow
- [ ] Serious but confused academic

## 3 Eras of Sallows thought
1. Pre-Leader: naive ideologue interested in security and stability
2. Leader: most dishonest, often sounded like before he led but vastly more euphemistic. 
3. EoL: Critical of a bloated state beuracracy, which he was responsible for (most of the manuscripts he wrote were never published but one was)
