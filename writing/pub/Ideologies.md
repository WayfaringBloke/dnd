## What kind of Sallow reader are you
- [ ] Shameless oppurtunist 
- [ ] Joker who's never read Sallow
- [ ] Serious but confused academic

## 3 Eras of Sallows thought
1. Pre-Leader: naive ideologue interested in security and stability
2. Leader: most dishonest, often sounded like before he led but vastly more euphemistic. 
3. EoL: Critical of a bloated state beuracracy, which he was responsible for (most of the manuscripts he wrote were never published but one was)
